Subject: Still can't get sound effects to work with v1.4 on an MSB....

I'm still having a problem with using a Microsoft Sound Board. Music works
fine, but sound effects will ONLY work on the PC-Speaker. I've installed:

    DEVICE=C:\SNDSYS\WSSXLAT.EXE SBIO=220 IRQ=7 DMA=1 WAVE=7 LINEIN=7

in CONFIG.SYS and made the approprate selections in DOOM\SETUP:

    SOUND BLASTER, PORT=220, IRQ=7, DMA=1, MIX=7

I've looked everywhere in the news groups/FAQ's for info but have had no
luck... is there a magic incantation that I'm missing????

BTW:	I'm still trying to break away an OSF/Alpha-PC for you guys...

Subject: DOOM 1.4

Here are my observations on 1.4:

On my system (386SX and GUS) version 1.2 used to always lockup in E1M3 where
the stairway rises to get to the normal exit (not the secret one).

Version 1.4 doesn't lockup here, but a lot of awful sounds are produced.

The gunshot sounds don't appear to be synchronized to the gunshot graphics  
(hear
sounds and then see the graphics).

The sounds no longer sound clean, but sound scratchy (sound plus noise).

Hello John!

Thanks again for the great game! Version 1.4 fixes a lot of the
problems I had with 1.2 (especially the "guy running in circles" bug).
However, there are still several bugs left. Too bad that I can't take
a look at the other two episodes; I know several map bugs there and
could help to fix them. My advice is that you don't release 1.5 on
July 1, but relase the patch to the commercial version instead, and
have them beta-tested by the net too.

Anyway, here goes my bug report. A few of the bugs I couldn't verify
myself - either because I don't have a soundcard (one student here who
has GUS has reported them), or because the new version does not allow
me to load custom-designed levels.

1) PAS16 sound is not in stereo. (Have not verified this.)

2) GUS sound effects are *much* worse than in 1.2. (Have not verified
this.)

3) The sound of raising stairs does not sound very well on a
SoundBlaster 16. (Have not verified this.)

4) LMPs recorded with version 1.2 do not run on 1.4. :-( Sigh. I kinda
expected it - the same happened when we switched from 1.1 to 1.2. Too
bad; now we have to scrap hundreds of kilobytes of amazing demos. Oh,
well, I guess this cannot be fixed - especially if you modify the maps
a bit and you have done that. Maybe you should mention this in the
README file.

5) Saved games from earlier versions crash the new version. The screen
just goes black and I have to reboot. Again, I expected something like
that - could you provide a conversion utility, or at least document
the incompatibility?

6) For some reason, chat macros 1 and 2 are always the same - seems
that one of them overwrites the other. This bug was present in 1.2; I
expected to see it fiexed.

7) Now the armour counter cannot exceed 200%. I suspect that this is
intentional, but I don't like it. Can't you return you the old way?
And while you are at it, can't you also remove the limit on the health
counter (199%)?

8) I see that you have removed the swastika. I was really
disappointed. Not because I particularly liked it, but because I was
thinking "Look, everybody is bashing id for that swastika, but they
don't care! What guys!". Sigh... I don't insist on having it back, but
I feel disappointed.

9) Projectiles now do not trigger linedefs any more. Yes, I know that
this is intentional and documented, but I don't like it. There is a
really amazing custom PWAD around (SCREAM.WAD; I can send it to you on
request), which includes a nice puzzle - a cage closes around you, and
you have to fire a rocket (all you have is a rocket launcher and a
pistol) towards a particular direction, in order to be able to escape.
Now this PWAD won't work any more. Can't you put this feature back?

10) I played a cooperative multi-player game with a colleague,
simultaneously doing a recording. I mostly wanted to see whether I can
do it, because of the problems in this area with version 1.2. The
level was E1M8. During the game, we played for too long and the LMP
buffer was exchausted (yes, I know that I can specify a larger buffer,
but I forgot to do it). Doom dropped to DOS, with the following
message on *one* of the machines: W_CacheLumpNUM:1266 >= numlumps.
However, the LMPs were created successfully. Now, the problem is to
play them. The file created on the other machine plays perfectly. The
file created on the machine that displayed the error message causes
Doom to display the same error message when one tries to play that
file. I saved both files; do you need a copy of them?

11) Speaking about multi-player LMPs, could you make it possible to
record them on one of the machines only? As it is now, each machine
has to do the recording, which is a bit annoying. (If only one of the
machines is doing the recording, the game aborts soon after the first
moves, with a consistency failure.)

12) Version 1.2 had a problem when you have a sector with both floor
and ceiling textures set to F_SKY. Is it fixed in 1.4? I can't check
it, because the -file option does not work.

13) With version 1.2, when you load a HUGE PWAD, and try to save the
game, the game crashes - probably because the size of the savegame
buffer is exceeded. Have you done something about this? Any capability
to increase the size of the savegame buffer - or at least to document
its size? Again, I cannot check this, because I am unable to load
external PWADs.

14) In version 1.2, when you had more than 64 Things in sight, some of
them were disappearing (at random) and then reappearing. Anything done
about this in 1.4? Again - I cannot check it.

15) In version 1.2, when you had too many linedefs in the line of
sight, you got horrible video effects (we call them Hall of Mirrors).
Anything done to fix this?

16) You mentioned that you have fixed "microscopic map bugs". Well,
some time ago I mailed a list of them to Sandy. I saw that several of
them are *not* fixed in Episode 1, version 1.4. Here is a list of them
again. I am aware that your level editor does not display such things
like linedef numbers and sector numbers. I'll try to describe where
the bugs are, but the best solution would be for you to get any of the
available level editors (I recommend DEU) - they all can display this
information.

E1M2:

Line 134, secondary Sidedef 151 is missing an Upper texture. This is
the T-like sector where the green armor is.

Line 574, secondary Sidedef 727 is missing an Upper texture. In fact,
the whole Sector 187 must be removed. This is in front of the door
that leads to the chainsaw and which you have to shoot in order to
make it open.

E1M3:

Sector 7 is not closed! You must join vertexes 764 and 771. This is
the southwest corner of the level near the regular (non-secret) exit,
where there are a lot of former humans and sergeants.

E1M4:

Linedefs 608 and 609 have a Sector Tag, but their type is set to
Normal (i.e., they don't trigger anything). This is to the north of
the circular building with the four doors, imps, chain gun and the
blue keycard.

Linedef 321, primary Sidedef 345 is missing a Lower texture.
Linedef 327, primary Sidedef 353 is missing a Lower texture.
Linedef 338, primary Sidedef 369 is missing a Lower texture.
Linedef 346, primary Sidedef 379 is missing a Lower texture.

Those are on the back side of each of the four doors of the circular
building mentioned above.

Linedef 693, secondary Sidedef 872 is missing an Upper texture. This
is at the beggining of the corridor that begins from the southeast
corner of that same circular building.

E1M7:

Linedef 450, secondary Sidedef 573 is missing an upper texture. In
fact, the whole Sector 37 should be removed. This is the east one of
the two L-like constructs in the "upper floor" behind the yellow door.

Linedef 744, secondary Sidedef 938 is missing a Lower texture.
Linedef 745, secondary Sidedef 940 is missing a Lower texture.
Linedef 746, secondary Sidedef 942 is missing a Lower texture.
Linedef 747, secondary Sidedef 944 is missing a Lower texture.

Those lines are around the square pyramid that contains the chainsaw.

E1M8:

I see that you have added a new room in one of the cages with Barons,
with a switch that lowers the lift and allows the player to return to
the beginning of the level. Maybe you should have marked this room as
Secret.

The walls that surround the big courtyard after the internal walls
drop down (after you kill the Barons) do not display on the map. It
might be intentional, but it is not good, because you can "see" those
walls. I can understand why the final room is not displayed, but those
walls should be.

Also, one all the levels there are a lot of unnecessary textures, but
the level editor I am using does not allow me to find them easily, so
I am unable to report them. I have another editor, which can report
them, but it requires the registered version. (The one I am using at
least allows me to *view* - if not to modify - the levels of the
shareware version.)

If you have any questions regarding the bugs I reported above, or need
any further clarifications, do not hesistate to contact me. I'll do my
best to help you improve further this awesome game.

Regards,
Vesselin

	Hi!  I have a few complaints about Doom 1.4:
	Sometimes during play in e1m1 (only this level for some reason) I
experience sound problems.  Either the music volume drops suddenly, or random
game sounds get played (usually the chainsaw :) ).
	Another thing (not really a bug I guess) is that the sound of stairs
going up is funny.  Maybe its something having to do with the stereo effect,
but it's disconcerting.  Like the sound is being sourced from the leading edge
of the rising stairs.  It's okay; but it just sounds weird.
	Hope this helps... if you even get to read it...
	Bye!

Subject: [Bug] 3 bugs in Doom 1.4

Hi John!

Do I get a prize for spotting a bug in Doom 1.4
in the quickest time? As soon as I unzipped it,
I ran setup, configured it to GUS, 8ch, and then
selected keyboard-mouse controls. I then tried
to redefine the right button as 'move forward'.
An errorbox popped up saying 'mouse not present',
and the setup hung. Not completely, as Ctrl-Alt-
Delete worked.

Also, I noticed that the GUS sound effects are much
more tinny than under 1.2, as if the high frequencies
are being boosted. Is this a bug, or just changed
preference on iD's part?

One last bug (think yourself lucky, I'd be grateful
for only 3 bugs :-), the GUS sound now has the 

infamous clicks!

Anyway, that's all (with these problems I went back
to playing 1.2). On a more positive note, it is
noticeably faster than 1.2, although much of this
speedup may be due to the GUS being used better?

You may have already heard this from other Doom fans, but it seems that
1.4 now repeats sound effects. I have a Compaq 486SX/25 4MB RAM and a 

SB16 w/o ASP and and MPU-401 card. When you open a door it sounds like
it opens twice. The General MIDI support seems MUCH improved though, no more
sustaining guitars!! Thanks.

    It looks like the SB support is thrashed in V1.4.  I am

than that, we havent had any problems here (and we have played

Hi John!  Doom is a great game and I just downloaded the 1.4 Beta from 

the Internet today and I have a Sound Blaster Pro set at defaults (220 

hex, IRQ7, and DMA 1) and when I set Doom to play 8 channels, I seem to 

get a strange echoing when any sound is played.  But if I turn the 

sounds down to 4, it seems to work ok.  Now am I just confused and the 

SBPro just can't handle that many channels at once or do I need to set 

to a different IRQ?  Just thought I would ask you for the help.  Thanks 

in advance.  You can reply straight back to me if you would like.  Talk 

at you later.  :)

I know you've probably already heard these bugs, but just in case:

1.  SB16 sounds lousy.  Sounds are muffled, rising staircases have multiple
    volume levels as the sectors rise.  This may be due to use of more than
    4 mixed sounds.  


Here's my system setup, in case you need the info:

i486DX2-50, 4MB RAM, MouseSystems Mouse & Driver, Sound Blaster 16 ASP

That should be all pertinent information.  If you need more info to help

Hello,

I just tried DOOM v1.4 after downloading it from the internet site. It looks
good except for two problems. First it runs quite a bit slower than v1.2, and
the sound seems very "tinny" like there is two much treble. I have a
486DX2/50 with 8 MB RAM, DOS 6.2, Stacker 3.1, and a Gravis UltraSound. I had
none of the above problems with DOOM v1.2 Thanks for your help. And thank you
for making such an excellent game!

Last night I tried the DOOM v1.4 beta you uploaded to infant2.

I'm not sure if it's really a bug, but the quality of the sound
effects on my Gravis Ultrasound (hardware rev. 3.4) seems to have
decreased considerably to compared to DOOM v1.2.  The sounds are
somewhat harsh, noisy and distorted.  The music sounds fine.

Reconfiguring DOOM to use my SoundBlaster 2.0 improved sound FX
quality considerably (but of course the music sux :^)

A minor point is that the documentation has references to DOOM
v1.2 all over the place.  I suppose you'll have that cleaned up
for v1.5?  It made me wonder if it was a legitimate release.

If you need more details, feel free to e-mail me.

Hello...

I've got a problem with DOOM 1.4 and SB-Sound. Just after the " " message the
game locks up. I experience the same thing with the 1.1 version of Raptor,
which seems to use the same F/X engine. It all happens with and without QEMM.
(SB 1.5, Irq 5, A 220, D1, no problems anywhere else.)

This may or may not be your bug, but the GUS I believe is the only
one we've heard this for, and we know there's something funny w/
the current GUS code.

> Bug found in DOOM 1.4 June 30/94:
> Computer: 486DX33, ISA bus, 8 megs ram, PAS-16 sound card.
> Using IRQ 5, DMA 3.  Revision D of sound card, mvsound.sys 3.24
> DOOM setup: one player, PAS sound (3 digital channels) , PAS
> music, keyboard and MS mouse to control player
> The bug:
> On mission 5, at the point just beyond the yellow key-card door, to
