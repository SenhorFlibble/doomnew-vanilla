 - -oldsave parameter to load older save games (i.e. not the 1MB and 256 string
    size games).
 - -overridesave parameter to attempt forcing incorrect save game versions.
    Will likely crash, no guarantees.
 - Fixed readthisfullscreenhack boolean to work with KEY_ESCAPE. (whoops!)
 - Preliminary support for Chex Quest.  Some text needs to be changed.
   The coop intermission screen is kind of funky because the text is different 
   sizes compared to the original Doom.  I may just remove the coop intermission 
   screen entirely.
 - devparm was not being read properly from -shdev, -regdev, -comdev.
   It's fairly useless as F12 already allows screen shots now.
 - Music wasn't pausing from S_SetMusicVolume if it was set to 0.
   Still buggy with intermission and intro.  Basically, S_ChangeMusic.
 - Fixed the math for endmsg.  Was skipping over the "are you sure you want to
   quit this great game?" message.  Code from Chocolate Doom.
 - Now shows the "Picked up a healthkit that you really need!" message.
 - use_wpnbinds in DEFAULT.CFG.  If set to 1, the following defaults are used:
   * 'Q' for Rocket Launcher
   * 'Z' for Shotgun
   * 'X' for Chaingun
   * 'C' for Plasma
   These binds can be customized via the DEFAULT.CFG.  However, you must know
   the appropriate scancode.

 - Added Fullscreen Ammo, Armor, Health, and Keycards.
 - Imported the Cyberman/Tactile stuff from Heretic.
 - Added the original mprintf from DOS Doom.
 - Original gamemode determination banners, WATCOM specific stuff.
 - linear.asm from Heretic.  Might have some faster drawing on
   some 486-era stuff?
 - Joystick support working.
 - Fixed bug with joystick super speed.
 - Fixed byte *savep warning.
 - DOOM.WAD will search for Episode 4 and auto-load Ultimate Doom.
   Can be overridden with -doom parameter.
 - Fixed endstring/quit messages to work for proper gamemodes.
 - Palette Flashing toggle is now read from config.
 - Fixed Final Doom map names in Automap.
 - Fixed snd_SfxVolume multiplier shit. (it was shitty!)
 - From Heretic:
   * Hold down ESC during startup to abort execution of the game.
 - Checks for unnaturally high volume levels.
 - Fixed Plutonia and TNT (Final Doom) intermission text.
 - Fixed drawing a number for Fist and Chainsaw in Fullscreen.
 - Delete save games from Load and Save Menu by pressing delete.
 - Bumped SAVEGAMESIZE to ~1MB and SAVESTRINGSIZE from 24 to 256.
   Not sure if there is any stock Final Doom, etc. maps with a save
   issue, but can't hurt!
 - Disabled RANGECHECK ifdef.  Plutonia gave a bomb walking down a
   dark hallway with it.  I may turn it into a M_CheckParm at some point.

09-13-13
 - Fixed out of control input.
 - From Heretic v1.3a port:
   * P_SetMessage function.
   * New coop rules (keep keys, weapons, backpack).
   * Secret Area found message.
   * Massacre Cheat.
   * HHSCOTT Cheat -- instantly finish level.
 - Added -perdgate, -hell2pay, and -helltopay to load Perdition's Gate and
   Hell to Pay commercial Mega WADs.

09-12-13
 - Fixed music loading issues, doom 2 loading, etc.
 - Added -doomu, -doom, -doom2, -tnt, -plutonia to force a specific game.
   Will look for the proper WAD file to do so.
 - Fixed a few other misc details like some dpmi_lockregion related stuff
   for DMX sound, episode 2 and 3 buttons not showing the second one,
   the mnum = -9 hack, linuxness math fuckery, and probably other things 
   I don't remember currently.

09-11-13
 - Fixed graphics.
 - KEY_F12 now produces a screen shot.  No need for -devparm.

09-10-13
 - Sound and graphics.

09-09-13
 - Music.

06-01-13'ish
 - Compiling and linking with DMX.  No sound, music, graphics.  
   Broken WAD loading.
