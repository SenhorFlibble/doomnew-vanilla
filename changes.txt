 - Removed the DEH startup banners as it's causing a hard lock in
   debug compiled builds.
 - Hacked around braintargeton for Doom 2 final boss and save restores.
   Was causing crashes for me in Perdition's Gate.
 - noquitsound in EXTEND.CFG to disable the randomized quit sound.
 - Fixed MASSACRE cheat not killing Lost Souls.

10-06-13
 - If you're in a fake netgame (i.e. ipxsetup -nodes 1) you can
   now load a game or start a new one.

10-05-13
 - noprecache in EXTEND.CFG to disable graphics precaching.

10-04-13
 - "-gus" paramater now loads the wads internally from the EXE.
   You no longer need the GUS1M.WAD or GUS1MIID.WAD present to load it.
 - useIntGus in EXTEND.CFG to always autoload the updated GUS1M WADs.
 - Moved all the new config stuff to EXTEND.CFG.  Was starting to get
   out of hand.
 - novert is now in EXTEND.CFG as well.  Setting "-novert" will also
   toggle novert in EXTEND.CFG.

10-02-13
 - Draw Time clock on Automap with drawTime in config file.
   * Set to 1 for Military Time.
   * Set to 2 for Standard Time.

10-01-13
 - Automap code for keys (in easy skill) and secret doors from Heretic.

09-29-13
 - Put a "return" instead of a "break" in switch(gamemap) for Chex Quest.
   Was causing Map 5 finishes to trigger the Finale or nothing at all!
 - Fixed any menu displayed after M_SetMessage not displaying.
   i.e. The shareware Read This! screen after selecting Episode 2 or 3.
   Apparently, this bug was in the final v1.9 of Doom Shareware as well.
 - Fixed key spacing in fullscreen mode with Chex Quest.
 - Automap now shows "SECRETS FOUND: x/y".

09-28-13
 - Fixed "-skill 0" to be an invalid option as well as any other invalid
   number passed to "-skill".
 - Specify the main game WAD with -mainwad.  Useful for DEUSF stuff and you
   don't want to remember if you un-DEUSF'd something.
 - Fixed a few sillies with I_Update()'s.  Now the help screen doesn't have a 
   partial weird wipe going through it if you're viewing it during a demo
   transition.

09-26-13
 - Disk/CD-ROM flashing icon returns.  Again, thanks to Chocolate Doom.
 - Disk/CD-ROM flashing icon now toggable from DEFAULT.CFG with
   disk_flash_icon.

09-25-13
 - Fixed the sky never changing in Ultimate Doom.  Silly pack_plut and pack_tnt
   fuckin' my game up!
 - Fixed chainsaw pitch.  Just required removing the whole pitch hack in 
   general.  Again, thanks to Chocolate Doom.
 - Added the PC Speaker sound hacks; originally left in Heretic's I_Sound.c.

09-24-13
 - Using -loadgame or -convertsave will set the cursor in the main menu to the
   same slot.  Useful for netgames and just hitting F5 and enter.
 - Preliminary DEHACKED support!  Code from Chocolate Doom, readapted.
   Most functions are there, a few stray DEH_Strings remain.
   NO extended text or extended cheat text limit support.
 - PC Speaker returns!  Thanks to Chocolate Doom for the fix.

09-23-13
 - Weapon pick up text in Netgames.
 - No friendly fire in coop.
 - "-noexit" to disable exits in netgames.  Useful for DM maps.  Only works
   for valid netgames.  You can test it out with IPXSETUP.EXE -NODES 1
   -NOEXIT.

09-22-13
 - Default to Super Shotgun in Doom 2 games in coop if you have it.
 - Fixed -cdrom parameter.
 - The startup screen should now be extremely close to the original.
   The only thing that is changed is not showing the netgame parameters
   if you're starting single player.

09-21-13
 - Load a custom Gravis UltraSound INI file with -usegusini <filename.ini>.
   Error checks are in place to see if the file exists and if you passed
   something after -usegusini.

09-20-13
 - IDMUS is no longer a cheat.
 - From Heretic v1.3a port:
   * Player Died! message.
 - Disabled cheating in nightmare again, except IDDT and IDCLEV like original.

09-19-13
 - -convertsave <slot #> parameter.  Convert your old saves to the new ones!
   I don't think it will corrupt it, but do a backup first just in case.
 - Z_Free(&savebuffer) when you error out of incorrect versions.

09-18-13
 - Changed priority of the weapon pickup sound.  Stuff was taking over it, and
   I'm sure I don't remember Doom being that weird about it.

09-17-13
 - Fixed animated background intermissions.  Was if(commercial), needed to be
   if(gamemode == commercial).
 - Chex Quest:
   * No longer draws a coop stats intermission.  Text was overlapping,
     entirely way too large. Not worth the effort.
   * Chex(R) Quest Startup.
   * Chex Quest 2 map names.
   * Fixed the boss in Chex Quest 2 being unshootable.
   * Imported most of the Chex Quest Dehacked stuff.  The game is now
     mostly the same, except for a few messages regarding the
     chat macros and "net quest", etc.

09-16-13
 - Warning to use -oldsave.
 - "Sector type 17 is disabled after loading a save game" bug fixed.
   This causes the flickering strobe lights to be restored after loading a
   save. See more at:
   http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sector_type_17_is_disabled_after_loading_a_saved_game

09-15-13
 - -oldsave parameter to load older save games (i.e. not the 1MB and
    256 string size games).
 - Fixed readthisfullscreenhack boolean to work with KEY_ESCAPE. (whoops!)
 - Preliminary support for Chex Quest.  Some text needs to be changed.
   The coop intermission screen is kind of funky because the text is different 
   sizes compared to the original Doom.  I may just remove
   the coop intermission screen entirely.
 - devparm was not being read properly from -shdev, -regdev, -comdev.
   It's fairly useless as F12 already allows screen shots now.
 - Music wasn't pausing from S_SetMusicVolume if it was set to 0.
   Still buggy with intermission and intro.  Basically, S_ChangeMusic.
 - Fixed the math for endmsg.  Was skipping over the "are you sure you want to
   quit this great game?" message.  Code from Chocolate Doom.
 - Now shows the "Picked up a healthkit that you really need!" message.
 - use_wpnbinds in DEFAULT.CFG.  If set to 1, the following defaults are used:
   * 'Q' for Rocket Launcher
   * 'Z' for Shotgun
   * 'X' for Chaingun
   * 'C' for Plasma
   These binds can be customized via the DEFAULT.CFG.  However, you must know
   the appropriate scancode.

09-14-13
 - Added Fullscreen Ammo, Armor, Health, and Keycards.
 - Imported the Cyberman/Tactile stuff from Heretic.
 - Added the original mprintf from DOS Doom.
 - Original gamemode determination banners, WATCOM specific stuff.
 - linear.asm from Heretic.  Might have some faster drawing on
   some 486-era stuff?
 - Joystick support working.
 - Fixed bug with joystick super speed.
 - Fixed byte *savep warning.
 - DOOM.WAD will search for Episode 4 and auto-load Ultimate Doom.
   Can be overridden with -doom parameter.
 - Fixed endstring/quit messages to work for proper gamemodes.
 - Palette Flashing toggle is now read from config.
 - Fixed Final Doom map names in Automap.
 - Fixed snd_SfxVolume multiplier shit. (it was shitty!)
 - From Heretic:
   * Hold down ESC during startup to abort execution of the game.
 - Checks for unnaturally high volume levels.
 - Fixed Plutonia and TNT (Final Doom) intermission text.
 - Fixed drawing a number for Fist and Chainsaw in Fullscreen.
 - Delete save games from Load and Save Menu by pressing delete.
 - Bumped SAVEGAMESIZE to ~1MB and SAVESTRINGSIZE from 24 to 256.
   Not sure if there is any stock Final Doom, etc. maps with a save
   issue, but can't hurt!
 - Disabled RANGECHECK ifdef.  Plutonia gave a bomb walking down a
   dark hallway with it.  I may turn it into a M_CheckParm at some point.

09-13-13
 - Fixed out of control input.
 - From Heretic v1.3a port:
   * P_SetMessage function.
   * New coop rules (keep keys, weapons, backpack).
   * Secret Area found message.
   * MASSACRE Cheat.
   * HHSCOTT Cheat -- instantly finish level.
 - Added -perdgate, -hell2pay, and -helltopay to load Perdition's Gate and
   Hell to Pay commercial Mega WADs.

09-12-13
 - Fixed music loading issues, doom 2 loading, etc.
 - Added -doomu, -doom, -doom2, -tnt, -plutonia to force a specific game.
   Will look for the proper WAD file to do so.
 - Fixed a few other misc details like some dpmi_lockregion related stuff
   for DMX sound, episode 2 and 3 buttons not showing the second one,
   the mnum = -9 hack, linuxness math fuckery, and probably other things 
   I don't remember currently.

09-11-13
 - Fixed graphics.
 - KEY_F12 now produces a screen shot.  No need for -devparm.

09-10-13
 - Sound and graphics.

09-09-13
 - Music.

06-01-13'ish
 - Compiling and linking with DMX.  No sound, music, graphics.  
   Broken WAD loading.

12-19-12
 - First attempt.
